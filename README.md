# Nvimkit.nvim

Easily create Sveltekit routes with a single command.

> ðŸš§ THIS PLUGIN IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION. The core functionality is implemented, but key features are yet to be implemented. It is also largely untested, and I can only guarantee it works on my system (arch btw). INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Installation

### Lazy.nvim
